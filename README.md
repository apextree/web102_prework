## Notes
Working with Flex containers in CSS was somewhat challenging and required extra attention to make sure everything looked good even when the viewport changed in size and aspect ratio. Another challenge was trying to figure out how best to create the frontend so that it looks aesthetically pleasing, matched the ocean theme and also did not look too extra as to take away from the core functionality of the webpage itself. My code editor's visual theme's lack of adequate syntax highlighting prevented me from noticing a typo in a function name in one of the earlier challenges.
